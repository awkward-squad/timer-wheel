-- | A 'TimerWheel' is a vector-of-collections-of timers to fire. It is
-- configured with a /spoke count/ and /resolution/. A timeout thread is spawned
-- to step through the timer wheel and fire expired timers at regular intervals.
--
-- * The /spoke count/ determines the size of the timer vector.
--
--     * A __larger spoke count__ will result in __less insert contention__ at
--       each spoke and will require __more memory__ to store the timer wheel.
--
--     * A __smaller spoke count__ will result in __more insert contention__ at
--       each spoke and will require __less memory__ to store the timer wheel.
--
-- * The /resolution/ determines both the duration of time that each spoke
--   corresponds to, and how often the timeout thread wakes. For example, with a
--   resolution of __@1s@__, a timer that expires at __@2.5s@__ will not fire
--   until the timeout thread wakes at __@3s@__.
--
--     * A __larger resolution__ will result in __more insert contention__ at
--       each spoke, __less accurate__ timers, and will require
--       __fewer wakeups__ by the timeout thread.
--
--     * A __smaller resolution__ will result in __less insert contention__ at
--       each spoke, __more accurate__ timers, and will require __more wakeups__
--       by the timeout thread.
--
-- * The timeout thread has three important properties:
--
--     * There is only one, and it fires expired timers synchronously. If your
--       timer actions execute quicky, 'register' them directly. Otherwise,
--       consider registering an action that enqueues the /real/ action to be
--       performed on a job queue.
--
--     * Synchronous exceptions thrown by enqueued @IO@ actions will bring the
--       thread down, and no more timeouts will ever fire. If you want to catch
--       exceptions and log them, for example, you will have to bake this into
--       the registered actions yourself.
--
--     * The life of the timeout thread is scoped to the life of the timer
--       wheel. When the timer wheel is garbage collected, the timeout thread
--       will automatically stop doing work, and die gracefully.
--
-- Below is a depiction of a timer wheel with @6@ timers inserted across @8@
-- spokes, and a resolution of @0.1s@.
