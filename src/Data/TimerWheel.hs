-- | A 'TimerWheel' is a vector-of-collections-of timers to fire. It is
-- configured with a /bucket count/ and /accuracy/.
--
-- An reaper thread is used to step through the timer wheel and fire expired
-- timers.
--
-- * The /bucket count/ determines the size of the timer vector.
--
--     * A __larger__ bucket count will result in __less__ 'register' contention
--       at each individual bucket and require __more__ memory to store the
--       timer wheel.
--
--     * A __smaller__ bucket count will result in __more__ 'register'
--       contention at each individual bucket and require __less__ memory to
--       store the timer wheel.
--
-- * The /accuracy/ determines how often the reaper thread wakes, and thus
--   how accurately timers fire per their registered expiry time.
--
--   For example, with an /accuracy/ of __@1s@__, a timer that expires at
--   __@t = 2.05s@__ will not fire until the reaper thread wakes at
--   __@t = 3s@__.
--
--     * A __larger__ accuracy will result in __less__ accurate timers and
--       require __less__ work by the reaper thread.
--
--     * A __smaller__ accuracy will result in __more__ accurate timers and
--       require __more__ work by the reaper thread.
--
-- * The reaper thread has two important properties:
--
--     * There is only one, and it fires expired timers synchronously. If your
--       timer actions are very cheap and execute quicky, 'register' them
--       directly. Otherwise, consider registering an action that enqueues the
--       real action to be performed on a queue.
--
--     * Synchronous exceptions are completely ignored. If you want to handle
--       exceptions, bake that logic into the registered action itself.
--
-- Below is an example of a timer wheel with __@8@__ buckets and an accuracy of
-- __@0.1s@__.
--
-- @
--    0s   .1s   .2s   .3s   .4s   .5s   .6s   .7s   .8s
--    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
--    |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
--    +-|---+-|---+-|---+-|---+-|---+-|---+-|---+-|---+
--      |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
--      |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
--      ∅     A     ∅     B,C   D     ∅     ∅     E,F,G
-- @
--
-- A timer registered to fire at __@t = 1s@__ would be bucketed into index
-- __@2@__ and would expire on the second "lap" through the wheel when the
-- reaper thread advances to index __@3@__.
