-- | A timer wheel is a vector-of-collections-of timers to fire. Timers may be one-shot or recurring, and may be
-- scheduled arbitrarily far in the future.
--
-- A timer wheel is configured with a /spoke count/ and /resolution/:
--
-- * The /spoke count/ determines the size of the timer vector.
--
--     A __larger spoke count__ will require __more memory__, but will result in __less insert contention__.
--
-- * The /resolution/ determines the duration of time that each spoke corresponds to, and thus how often timers are
--   checked for expiry.
--
--     For example, in a timer wheel with a /resolution/ of __@1 second@__, a timer that is scheduled to fire at
--     __@8.4 o'clock@__ will end up firing around __@9.0 o'clock@__ instead (that is, on the
--     __@1 second@__-boundary).
--
--     A __larger resolution__ will result in __more insert contention__ and __less accurate timers__, but will require
--     __fewer wakeups__ by the timeout thread.
--
-- The timeout thread has some important properties:
--
--     * There is only one, and it fires expired timers synchronously. If your timer actions execute quicky, you can
--       'register' them directly. Otherwise, consider registering an action that enqueues the real action to be
--       performed on a job queue.
--
--     * A synchronous exception thrown by a registered timer will bring the timeout thread down, and the exception will
--       be propagated to the thread that created the timer wheel. If you want to log and ignore exceptions, for example,
--       you will have to bake this into the registered actions yourself.

-- Timer reaper thread
--
-- The main loop is rather simple, but the code is somewhat fiddly. In brief, the reaper thread wakes up to fire all of
-- the expired timers in bucket N, then sleeps, then wakes up to fire all of the expired timers in bucket N+1, then
-- sleeps, and so on, forever.
--
-- It wakes up on the "bucket boundaries", that is,

--                           to fire all of the expired timers stored here
--
-- It's entirely possible the reaper thread gets hopelessly behind, that is, it's taken so long to expire all of the
-- timers in previous buckets that we're behind schedule an entire bucket or more. That might look like this:
--
--   +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
--   |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |
--   |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |

--                           ^                    ^
--                           |                    we are very behind, and enter the loop around here
--                           |
--                           yet we nonetheless fire all of the expired timers stored here, as if we were on time
--
-- That's accomplished simplly by maintaining in the loop state the "ideal" time that we wake up, ignoring reality. We
-- only ultimately check the *actual* current time when determining how long to *sleep* after expiring all of the timers
-- in the current bucket. If we're behind schedule, we won't sleep at all.

--                                                  not caring how far ahead the actual current time is
--
-- On to expiring timers: a "bucket" of timers is stored at each array index, which can be partitioned into "expired"
-- (meant to fire at or before the ideal time) and "not expired" (to expire on a subsequent wrap around the bucket
-- array).
--
--   +-----------------------+
--   |           /           |
--   | expired  /            |
--   |         / not expired |
--   |        /              |
--   +-----------------------+
--
-- The reaper thread simply atomically partitions the bucket, keeping the expired collection for itself, and putting the
-- not-expired collection back in the array.
--
-- Next, the timers are carefully fired one-by-one, in timestamp order. It's possible that two or more timers are
-- scheduled to expire concurrently (i.e. on the same nanosecond); that's fine: we fire them in the order they were
-- scheduled.
--
-- Let's say this is our set of timers to fire.
--
--    Ideal time         Timers to fire
--   +--------------+   +-----------------------------+
--   | 700          |   | Expiry | Type               |
--   +--------------+   +--------+--------------------+
--                      | 630    | One-shot           |
--    Next ideal time   | 643    | Recurring every 10 |
--   +--------------+   | 643    | One-shot           |
--   | 800          |   | 689    | Recurring every 80 |
--   +--------------+   +--------+--------------------+
--
-- Expiring a one-shot timer is simple: call the IO action and move on.
--
-- Expiring a recurring timer is less simple (but still simple): call the IO action, then schedule the next occurrence.
-- There are two possibilities.
--
--   1. The next occurrence is *at or before* the ideal time, which means it ought to fire along with the other timers
--      in the queue, right now. So, insert it into the collection of timers to fire.
--
--   2. The next occurrence is *after* the ideal time, so enqueue it in the array of buckets wherever it belongs.
--
-- After all expired timers are fired, the reaper thread has one last decision to make: how long should we sleep? We
-- get the current timestamp, and if it's still before the next ideal time (i.e. the current ideal time plus the wheel
-- resolution), then we sleep for the difference.
--
-- If the actual time is at or after the next ideal time, that's kind of bad - it means the reaper thread is behind
-- schedule. The user's enqueued actions have taken too long, or their wheel resolution is too short. Anyway, it's not
-- our problem, our behavior doesn't change per whether we are behind schedule or not.
