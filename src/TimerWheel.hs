-- | A timer wheel is a vector-of-collections-of timers to fire. It is configured with a /spoke count/ and /resolution/.
-- Timers may be scheduled arbitrarily far in the future. A timeout thread is spawned to step through the timer wheel
-- and fire expired timers at regular intervals.
--
-- * The /spoke count/ determines the size of the timer vector.
--
--     * A __larger spoke count__ will result in __less insert contention__ at each spoke and will require
--       __more memory__ to store the timer wheel.
--
--     * A __smaller spoke count__ will result in __more insert contention__ at each spoke and will require
--       __less memory__ to store the timer wheel.
--
-- * The /resolution/ determines both the duration of time that each spoke corresponds to, and how often the timeout
--   thread wakes. For example, with a resolution of __@1s@__, a timer that expires at __@2.5s@__ will not fire until
--   the timeout thread wakes at __@3s@__.
--
--     * A __larger resolution__ will result in __more insert contention__ at each spoke, __less accurate__ timers, and
--       will require __fewer wakeups__ by the timeout thread.
--
--     * A __smaller resolution__ will result in __less insert contention__ at each spoke, __more accurate__ timers, and
--       will require __more wakeups__ by the timeout thread.
--
-- * The timeout thread has some important properties:
--
--     * There is only one, and it fires expired timers synchronously. If your timer actions execute quicky, 'register'
--       them directly. Otherwise, consider registering an action that enqueues the /real/ action to be performed on a
--       job queue.
--
--     * Synchronous exceptions thrown by enqueued @IO@ actions will bring the thread down, and the exception will be
--       propagated to the thread that created the timer wheel. If you want to catch exceptions and log them, for
--       example, you will have to bake this into the registered actions yourself.
--
-- As an example, below is a depiction of a timer wheel with @6@ timers inserted across @8@ spokes, and a resolution of
-- @.1s@. It depicts a cursor at @.3s@, which indicates where the timeout thread currently is.

-- @
--
-- After @.1s@, the timeout thread will advance to the next spoke and process all of the timers it passed over. In
-- this case, __C__ will fire, and __B__ will be put back with its count decremented to @0@. This is how the timer wheel
-- can schedule a timer to fire arbitrarily far in the future: its count is simply the number of times its delay wraps
-- the entire duration of the timer wheel.
