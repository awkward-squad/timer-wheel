## Unreleased

### Changed
- If the timer wheel reaper thread crashes, it will propagate the exception to
the thread that spawned it.
- `new` may now throw `InvalidTimerWheelConfig`
- The cancel action returned by `register` is now memoized, which fixes a bug
involving trying to cancel a `recurring` timer twice. The second call used to
spin forever and peg a CPU.
